# Testing Strategy

## Scope
Outline levels of testing.

## Test Pyramid (Planned)
- Unit: Fast, pure logic
- Integration: Boundary interactions
- E2E (if needed): External contract

## Tooling (Planned)
- pytest
- coverage
- hypothesis (property-based) optional

## Conventions
Tests under `tests/` mirroring source tree.
