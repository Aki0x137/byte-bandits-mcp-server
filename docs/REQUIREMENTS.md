## Open Questions
- How to handle tool versioning and backward compatibility?
- What's the optimal timeout configuration for external web requests?
- Should we implement rate limiting for tool calls?
- How to handle large file uploads for image processing tools?
- What's the preferred deployment strategy (cloud platform recommendations)?
- Should we implement tool usage analytics/logging?
- How to handle tool dependencies and optional features gracefully?
- What's the testing strategy for integration with Puch AI?
